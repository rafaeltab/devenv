How is the repository structured, where do what projects go, and why?

## Requirements

This section outlines the requirements that were taken in consideration while defining the file
structure.

1. Independent from tool preferences
2. Good separation
3. Well defined
4. Flexible and simple
5. Intuitive
6. Support migration

### Definition

The file structure consists of 6 main sections.

1. Documentation
2. Configuration
3. Applications
4. Scripts
5. Legacy support
6. Support files

Each workspace **must** have a `package.json` file, containing all scripts necessary to work with
the workspace. For the documentation this includes `dev`, `build`, `start` and `postinstall`, each
serving a different purpose for interacting with the repository.

#### Documentation

The documentation has a dedicated workspace in the `/docs` folder. This allows grouping all
documentation in one common location.

This workspace **must not** contain `README` files for each specific workspace, these **must** be
colocated with their workspace. This workspace **must** contain all other non-code documentation,
including but not limited to guidelines, usage guides, and blogs. Code **must** still be documented
using comments, doc comments, or other means that are normal for the language used.

#### Configuration

Each tool configuration has a dedicated workspace in the `/config/<tool>/` folder. This means all
configuration is grouped together, while each specific tool still has it's own place.

Each tool **must** be in it's own workspace inside the `/config` folder, they **must** not share a
workspace. The actual configuration files **must** be inside a `src` folder inside the workspace of
the tool it belongs to, and example being `/config/neovim/src/.config/nvim/init.lua`.

#### Applications

Applications have their own place inside a dedicated `/apps/<app>` folder. This means all
applications are grouped together, while also having a dedicated place for each application.

Each application **must** be inside their dedicated folder, but **may** specify multiple workspaces inside
their folder. An example is `apps/order-service/domain` and `apps/order-service/application`,
these would be separate workspaces, yet be used for the same application. If an application has multiple
possible entrypoints, such as a CLI, and an HTTP API, these **must** be separate workspaces inside
the same shared application folder. An example is `apps/calculator/cli` and
`apps/calculator/api`. Applications **must** use a `src` folder for their code.

#### Scripts

Scripts are all inside the same `/scripts` folder, without having a separate workspace per script.
This makes it easier to add scripts, which often are added quickly without significant planning.

Script files **must** be inside the `src` folder inside the `/scripts` workspace, though they
**may** be nested inside the `src` folder. An example is `/scripts/src/git/prune_branches.sh`.

#### Legacy support

This folder purely exists to make it easier to migrate legacy repositories to the new file
structure. It **must not** container anything other than repositories that are in the progress of
being migrated, and they **must not** remain there for a significant amount of time.


#### Support files

Support files are located where they have to be, such as the `package.json` in the root workspace,
this is needed to support pnpm workspaces. There **must not** be any files outside of support files
outside of their dedicated workspaces.

## Detailed description

This section details the requirements, and how they are achieved in the reference file structure.

### Independent from tool requirements

Sometimes tools prefer a specific folder structure. The defined file structure must not yield to
these preferences.

As an example, dotfiles would rather have all dotfiles in the same folder, with
the actual dotfiles in the actual location they should be in on the disk. The folder structure must
instead enforce good separation between the different dotfiles, putting neovim in a different
workspace from tmux, etc. These workspaces can then contain the actual file location that it should
have on disk, but only inside a `src` folder for consistency.

This can be seen in the reference file structure in the `/config/neovim` workspace. Here the
actual disk location of the config should be `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`. However, the actual location
places the configuration first in a dedicated workspace, `/config/neovim`, making it easier to
find specific configuration files. It then also locations the actual configuration inside the `src`
folder, separating the configuration files, from monorepo specific files, such as the package.json,
and potential linting configuration.

### Good separation

One of the main purposes of a good file structure is to offer separation between different projects
or uses. Such uses include documentation, scripts, projects, and configuration.

It would be possible to throw everything together in one place, but this has many disadvantages. The
main concern is that it will be impossible to know which files are needed for which use case,
leading to change-averse inaction.

When use cases are well separated it will lead effortless evolution, new use cases can be added with
ease, and obscure, obsolete, or deprecated use cases can be eliminated without worry.

This requirement truly shines in the reference file structure, each tool configuration, each
project, and each use case has it's own dedicated place.

### Well defined

There is no point to having a file structure if it isn't well defined. The definition of a file
structure, is the creation of a file structure itself. Without a definition there is no file
structure, they're just files that someone decided to put in specific folders for an unknown
reason. Without a definition the reference file structure is only a bunch of files put into folders,
the addition of the definition makes it a file structure.

### Flexible and simple

The file structure must be flexible and simple, allowing new things to be added easily, and not hindering
change by over-complicating things. The reference file structure achieves this by forgoing dedicated
workspaces in certain places, such as in the scripts, but also by allowing additional workspaces
where necessary, such as in apps. Complexity is added where it serves a purpose.

### Intuitive

An unintuitive file structure serves the opposite purpose of what you want from a file structure. A
file structure needs to make it easier to find what you want, and easier to place things where they
should go. The reference file structure accomplishes this by separating concerns such as
documentation from configuration, and applications. The concerns are also well-documented meaning
anyone can know where something has to go, even if they don't understand it at first.

Concerns are not nested in weird ways, and it is clear from an eye shot where anything is located.
If you want to find the configuration for neovim you look in the `/config` folder, and then in the
`neovim` folder.

### Support migration

If file structures don't accomodate migration one of two things can happen. Either migration
stagnates because there is no good place to put things while they are in the middle of migration, or
the file structure gets diluted by having legacy concerns mixed with modern concerns.

The reference file structure accomodates this by having a dedicated `/legacy` folder, with a nested
folder for each thing being migrated. This naming also doesn't add confusion with a seemingly
logical choice, `migrations`, which may be added later for supporting migration from older versions
of the repository to newer versions.
